## Publishing to Kyso

You can publish articles, images, datasets and Jupyter notebooks to Kyso. In this article we will go through how to
write a post using Kyso's web editor, or by uploading. You can also import from Github, or publish using our Jupyterlab plugin.

### Writing an article using Kyso's web editor.

Use Kyso's web editor to create a post using markdown. Click on **New** in the top navigation bar and choose *Write a Post*

This will take you to our web editor where you can create your post. Refer to this [markdown guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to discover all of the different features you can include, from tables and images to linking and creating lists. When you are finishing, click *Publish My Blog*.

A modal will pop up where you can edit the post's title, description, tags and preview image. When you are satisfied, click *Submit*.

### Upload Charts, Datasets, Articles and Jupyter Notebooks

On Kyso, you can create a cool post by simply uploading existing files - these can be images, datasets, code, notebooks or markdown files. Click on New in the top navigation bar and choose *Upload*.

On the upload page, give your post a title. Then click on the empty box to open your file browser or drag & drop your files. You can upload multiple files, all under the one post. Before you **Publish** you will be prompted to select a main file. This file will be the one rendered by default when someone visits your post. Readers can also browse the other files.

Finally, enter a description, a tag and provide a preview image before posting. You will be automatically re-directed to the post on Kyso.
