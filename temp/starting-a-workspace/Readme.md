## Launching a Jupyterlab Instance on Kyso

You can start one of Kyso's workspaces, which launches an instance of Jupyterlab running on Kyso's custom Data Science and Machine Learning [docker image](https://kyso.io/KyleOS/kyso-docker-image). Click on New in the top navigation bar and choose *New Jupyterlab Workspace*.

Give your workspace a name and hit enter - you will be redirected to the *Workspaces* tab on your dashboard page, where you will see a list of all your current workspaces. You can stop and start workspaces as you wish. If you are on the pro plan, there will also be an option to keep the workspace alive, which means that the workspace will not switch off after ten minutes of inactivity.

Simply click on the workspace to launch the Jupyterlab environment in another tab.

When you are in your workspace and you are happy with your work, its easy to publish your notebooks to Kyso using the preinstalled [Kyso Jupyterlab extension](/jupyterlab-plugin/Readme.md)

__Note__: Kyso's workspaces are ephemeral. It is always good practice to back up your files & don't use the workspaces as a means to save or store data.
