# Getting started with Kyso

Kyso is a place where you can share your data-science work. You can publish Jupyter notebooks, charts, datasets
and write articles. You can also create projects in our Jupyterlab workspaces & publish them to the web.

Here you'll find an overview of everything you can do on Kyso. We do our best to make this documentation clear and user-friendly, but if you have any unanswered questions, please email us directly at support at kyso.io.
